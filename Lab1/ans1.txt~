5. /usr/bin/gcc is version 4.8.5 while plain gcc is version 9.2.0. 
   
   WHY ARE THEY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS?
       Different gcc files can be found in different paths. In this example, they are different file ultimately hence why the version number differs. The plain gcc was updated but /usr/bin/gcc was not.

	      C-h k C-M-u
	      C-h k C-M-v
13.
Quitting with 'C-g' is the way to get rid of a partially typed
command, or a numeric argument that you don't want.  Furthermore, if you
are in the middle of a command that is running, 'C-g' stops the command
in a relatively safe way.  For example, if you quit out of a kill
command that is taking a long time, either your text will _all_ still be
in the buffer, or it will _all_ be in the kill ring, or maybe both.  If
the region is active, 'C-g' deactivates the mark, unless Transient Mark
mode is off (*note Disabled Transient Mark::).  If you are in the middle
of an incremental search, 'C-g' behaves specially; it may take two
successive 'C-g' characters to get out of a search.  *Note Incremental
Search::, for details.


	Emacs Commands:
	      C-h K C-g
	      C-SPC

	ls -l /usr/bin
	emacs
	C-h r
	C-s
	C-x d
