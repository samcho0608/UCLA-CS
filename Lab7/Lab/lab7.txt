I initialized git on the CS35L directory previously
so I did not have to initiate git.

--------------------

To get a copy of the Diffutils folder, I used the
following git command:

git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

which created diffutils diretory in the current
directory

--------------------

I then cd'ed into the created directory and
got a log of it and outputed it into
git-log.txt file.

git log > git-log.txt

--------------------

To generate a list of tags used for Diffutils,
I employed the following command:

git tag > git-tags.txt

--------------------

Within the created git-log.txt file, I found
the hash id for the commit:

commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f

    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
    
    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.
    * HACKING, NEWS, README, README-hacking, TODO, doc/diagmeet.note:

Then I created the patch file of this commit using
the following command:

git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f --stdout > quote-patch.txt
