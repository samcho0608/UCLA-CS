1.

I ran the given code from the course website and obtained the following output:

gpg: Signature made Wed Dec 27 10:29:05 2017 PST using RSA key ID 306037D9 gpg:
Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>" gpg: aka "Pádraig Brady

I first ran ./configure
-prefix=/u/eng/class/classnho/CS35L/Lab3/Lab/coreutilsinstall.  But I did not
see any file created within the specified directory.

I then ran make and make install under coreutils-8.29 then finally got all the
necessary files.

To check what the error was, I tested the following line:

./ls -aA 
./ls -Aa 
./ls -aA ..  
./ls -Aa ..

All the of the above codes produced output containing '.' and '..'.

4.

I used the following code to patch:

patch -p1 <patchfile

5. 

I used the command make but it did not introduce any changes. I think this is
due to the fact that make built the file but did not execute the installment of
the updated coreutils. 

I had to use make install to have the update be installed and applied to
coreutils.

6.

I checked the newly updated ls using the same tests as above:

./ls -aA 
./ls -Aa 
./ls -aA ..  
./ls -Aa ..

Whenever -a was called after -A, the output included '.' and '..' whereas they
were not included when the commands were called the other way around. This
shows that the later-called argument overrides the previously-called argument.
