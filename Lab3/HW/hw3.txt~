Q1.

Patch: case 'A': - if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT) - ignore_mode =
IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT; + ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT; break;

The patch showed that the if statement was removed and the variable
ignore_mode will always be assigned IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT; This means
there are less operations because the program doesnot need to check
the conditional statement.

Q2.

Because shell scripts depends on the usage of shell commands, if there
was an application installed that utilized this specific function of
the command ls, it may run into an issue since the output from the ls
command will be different.

Q3.

When an empty file like /dev/null is passed in as an input for the
Python 2 script randline.py, the following error shows up:

Traceback (most recent call last): File "./randline.py", line 70, in
  <module> main() File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
  sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline()) File "./randline.py", line
  34, in chooseline return random.choice(self.lines) File
  "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice return
  seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] # raises IndexError if seq is
  empty IndexError: list index out of range

Explanation: The program randline.py opens and reads the lines inside
to extract a randome line, thus the variable which stores the lines,
self.lines, is empty. According to the error above, random.choice
raises error when the input is empty, which makes sense because one
cannot extract a random line from file that does not have any line.

Q4.

When passed in as an argument of randline.py, /dev/null results in the
following error:

  File "randline.py", line 65 except IOError as (errno, strerror): ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This happens because Python 3, which is a more recent version of
python, supports a few different syntax from that of Python 2. In
other words, Python 3 is not compatible with Python 2 code.

Q5.

My shuf.py script works just fine when run with Python 2 instead of
Python 3. According to my online research, this is because the later
version of Python 2, recognizing the increase in the usage of Python
3, adopted Python 3 extensions and such.
